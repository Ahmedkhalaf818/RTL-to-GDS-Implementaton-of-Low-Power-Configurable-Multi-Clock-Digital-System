# RTL-to-GDS-Implementaton-of-Low-Power-Configurable-Multi-Clock-Digital-System
It is responsible for receiving commands through the UART receiver to do different system functions as register file reading/writing or doing some processing using the ALU block, and sending the result to the UART transmitter through an asynchronous FIFO for handling different clock rates and avoiding data loss.
